# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections, Tom, requires assistance with the following tasks in order to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Obtain a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate total number of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.56.0\

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:

1. There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

2. The county turnout results were:
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

3. The largest county turnout was Denver. 

4. The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8%  of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.

5. The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  
## Challenge Overview
Using various Python functions, we were able to help Tom complete the required tasks to yield the results. By leveraging VS Code in conjunction with Python, we were able to analyze a large data set all on one screen. By pushing these changes to a text file and ultimately an online repsotory, election results are accessible to all.

## Challenge Summary
With some slight modifications, Tom's code can be apllied to any election. The two paramaters to consider are number of candidates and/or number of counties. By adjusting these two factors, Tom's code can be used to run a similar election on a city or state level. By further expanding the voter range and filtering to two primary candidates, Tom's code could be applied to a national election.
